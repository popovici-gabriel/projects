Create a Microservice that can serve stock prices using restful endpoints and display the
prices for a given day.

The files are located in resources/data
Each CSV file corresponds to ONE stock symbol's history per day.

A test spring boot project has been created to speed things up.
The H2 database is accessible at jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
The H2 console is started at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
The table name is STOCKS

Tasks:
1/ Write a service that imports all the CSV files from resources/data into the STOCKS database.
    You can use the openCSV library, which has been added to the pom.xml or any alternate solution.
    This service should execute each time the application is executed.
    NOTE: You can use Lombok to simplify the entity class although not a requirement.

2/ Create a controller which serves the following Restful properties:
    a) return a SINGLE stock object using the SYMBOL and DATE supplied (endpoint : /stock/get/SYMBOL/DATE [GET] , e.g.: /stock/AAPL/2017-12-31)
    b) return list of the stock object for a SYMBOL for ALL dates (endpoint: /stock/get/SYMBOL [GET])
    c) return ALL stock objects per DATE (endpoint: /stocks/DATE [GET])
    c) update stock close date of stock object for a given SYMBOL and DATE (endpoint: /stock/update/SYMBOL/DATE [POST])

3/ Create a controller that displays a page with the following:
    All tickers and their number of quotes, min-max Close prices (using SpringMVC and Thymeleaf)

4/ Write  tests  - try to use TDD
